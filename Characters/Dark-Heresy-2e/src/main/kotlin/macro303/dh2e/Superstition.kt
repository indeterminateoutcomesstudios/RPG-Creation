	`Thirsty Blade`(description = "The spirit of a weapon is a hungry ghost; it must taste blood every time it is drawn lest great ill befall those around it."),
	`Spirit Shackle`(description = "All items gain a portion of their owner's soul; taking a trophy from a vanquished foe brings the victor great luck."),

	`Comfortable Numbers`(description = "Only when surrounded with fellow hivers is the hive complete, and rooms should never be allowed to become bereft of crowded flesh."),
